Pulsed Radar

Radio waves have the intriguing nature where they could be reflected by metallic surfaces and refracted by dielectric surfaces, and this nature led to the development of the RAdio Detection And Ranging “RADAR”. It is a device that keeps on emitting and receiving Radio waves, those radio wave get reflected by a surface “Echo”, and is received back by the RADAR.
In this project, the whole process of sending a wave and recieveing, and calculating the distance is simulated by MATLAB,
Included: </br>
1-Plot the transmitted pulse at baseband </br>

2-Calculate the unambiguous Range (Ru), and the range resolution (Rmin).</br>

3-Plot the transmitted signal and the echo. You will need to add a suitable amount of noise to the received echo.</br>

4-plot the correlation between the transmitted signal and the noisy received echo.</br>

5-using multiple pulses and plot the average correlation plot, then use the averaged plot to calculate the target range</br>

As we can see from the previous results the average is nearly similar to the correlation and the peaks are similar to the received pulses which implies that the invention of the radar is crucial, for both economical and military sectors. Radars could be used to detect long ranged military bombers carrying large payloads before they start attacking.
